Gerrit Code Review is a code review system that provides a web user interface
on top of the Git version control system. Code changes are displayed side by
side and reviewers may add inline comments. Jenkins is an application for
monitoring repeated executions of jobs. Combining Jenkins with Gerrit Code
Review provides a simple way to facilitate continuous integration.
